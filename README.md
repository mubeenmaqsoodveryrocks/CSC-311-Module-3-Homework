# CSC-311-Module-3-Homework

I wrote a GUI program in Java that lets the user enter a loan amount, annual interest rate, and number of years.
When we click the Calculator button, we get the monthly payment and total payment.
I did this by using JavaFX.
I also made sure to write comments.
I did all this in the HelloApplication.java class.
